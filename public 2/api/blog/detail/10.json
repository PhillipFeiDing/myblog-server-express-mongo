The player will also encounter different types of NPC during travel and be able to interact with them in many ways.<br><br>This is a game project relating to a course I took at college. My team and I developed this game under the guidance of the course instructor, and the development involves completing timeboxed milestones. Since it is a course project, the technology we used was quite outdated: Java Swing. The game demoed here is the final deliverable version we created for the course.</span><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><br></span></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://github.com/PhillipFeiDing/myblog-resource/blob/master/space-trader-game/space-trader.jpg?raw=true\" style=\"max-width:100%;\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><br></span></p><br><h1>How to Play</h1><p><span style=\"font-size: large;\">You can play this game in two ways. One is to use the link below to access an online platform called Java Swing REPL, which is browser-based Java Swing, as cool as it sounds because it enables you to play the game in the browser without worrying about installing JRE and dependency libraries. However, there are two problems with this solution. First, it is very slow in terms of both loading the game (30 sec - 1 min) and getting a response after clicking on a button or something. Second, it is ugly. Our team was putting a tremendous amount of effort into creating beautiful layouts and outlooks, but it only worked with Mac OS. The Mac look-and-feel is propriety of Apple Inc., so on Windows and Linux a lot of graphical elements are not shown as we intended. Since most members in our team are Mac users and we did not care too much about GUI-related issues, we did not resolve this flaw in the final milestone deliverable.</span><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><br></span></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://repl.it/@FeiDing/space-trader\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"font-size: large;\">Java Swing REPL</a><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><br></span></p><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><br></div>\n\n<table border=\"0\" width=\"100%\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\"><tbody><tr><th><img src=\"https://github.com/PhillipFeiDing/myblog-resource/blob/master/space-trader-game/windows-game.png?raw=true\" style=\"max-width:100%; width: 400px;\">&nbsp;<br>Linux / Windows</th><th><img src=\"https://github.com/PhillipFeiDing/myblog-resource/blob/master/space-trader-game/mac-game.png?raw=true\" style=\"max-width:100%; width: 400px;\">&nbsp;<br>MacOS</th></tr></tbody></table><br><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">Also, here is an embedded version to try.</span></p><p><iframe height=\"900px\" width=\"100%\" src=\"https://repl.it/@FeiDing/space-trader?lite=true\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" sandbox=\"allow-forms allow-pointer-lock allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-modals\"></iframe></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: large;\">However, if you are a patient player with Mac OS and you happen to have JRE (Java Runtime Environment) installed in your system, you can try another way of playing this game. Simply download the .jar package listed below and launch with an easy click*. This will definitely bring the maximized experience for you.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><br></span></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://github.com/PhillipFeiDing/space-trader/raw/master/out/artifacts/M3Group66Latest_jar/SpaceTrader.jar\" style=\"font-size: large;\" download=\"\">SpaceTrader.jar</a><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><br>*: You may have to modify your security settings for the first time.

I am considering implementing them with JSON files in the future if necessary.</span><br></p><p></p><br><h1 style=\"text-align: left;\">Repository Link</h1><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://github.com/PhillipFeiDing/space-trader\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"font-size: large;\">Link to GitHub</a></p><p></p>",
