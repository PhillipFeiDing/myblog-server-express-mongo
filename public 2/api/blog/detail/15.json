Taking an overview of the college English classes I took in the past year (2 semesters), I have been exposed to virtually all modes of communication and felt more comfortable with which I used to struggle. The longer I retain and use these skills, the more I realize how they can benefit the rest of my life whenever I need to communicate myself to others under any circumstance.",
