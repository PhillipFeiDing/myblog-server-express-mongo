Here it goes.<br><br></span></p><blockquote><span style=\"font-size: large; font-style: italic;\">In a closed room there are exactly 100 people, and each person has exactly 100 dollars initially. In every minute everyone has to pick a random person among the 100 and give him/her 1 dollar. Therefore, after each minute, one could possibly gain some dollars from others, remain unchanged in wealth, or lose at most 1 dollar (in the case he/she gives out 1 dollar but received none).</span></blockquote><p><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: large;\">By common sense, everyone in the room has equal chance to gain or lose, so even after 1,000,000,000 rounds they should possess roughly equal amount of money. Is that true? Run the&nbsp;following simulation to verify!<br></span></p><p></p><p><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><br></span></p><p style=\"text-align: center; \"><iframe width=\"840\" height=\"472\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/B2KjgDsT3qI\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><br>A blue bar indicates that person still has money, while a red bar means that person is in debt. Bars are sorted in a way to help you visualize what is happening.</span><br><br></p><h1>Thoughts</h1><p><span style=\"font-size: large;\">Life is like this simulation, but without a “reset” button. The same trend persists as we run the simulation several times, so it can be generalized. Can you now feel a sense of enmity from some profound principles in life?<br></span><br></p><h1>Theory Behind: Probability Theory and Statistics</h1><p><span style=\"font-size: large;\">So what makes this counterintuitive effect? It all has to do with probability theory, which in application turns into statistical methods. The above example shows how data can diverge in the long run for some special cases. However, the real power of probability theory lies in its converging nature. Here are a few examples.</span><br><br><span style=\"font-size: large;\">First, let’s view a famous experiment with Pi. In calculus, we know there are fast converging Tylor Series for calculating the number efficiently. However, statisticians take a very different approach: by doing a real experiment to approximate.</span><br><br></p><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://github.com/PhillipFeiDing/myblog-resource/blob/master/computational-statistics-model/monteCarloPi.gif?raw=true\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"></div><br><span style=\"font-size: large;\">The method is named after&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method\" target=\"_blank\">Monte Carlo</a>, which has various applications in other fields as well.<br><br>Another example I bring involves a fundamental principle in probability theory, the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_limit_theorem\" target=\"_blank\">Central Limit Theorem (CLT)</a>, which I bring to a live simulation.
